    "In Python, a **list** is one of the most commonly used data structures. It allows you to store an ordered collection of items, which can be of different types. Here are the key features of lists in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Ordered**  \n",
    "   - Lists maintain the order of the elements as they were inserted. The order in which elements appear in a list is preserved, meaning that if you add items to a list, their order will remain unchanged unless you modify it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Mutable**  \n",
    "   - Lists are **mutable**, meaning you can change their contents (i.e., add, remove, or modify elements) after the list has been created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Indexable**  \n",
    "   - Elements in a list can be accessed by their **index** (i.e., their position in the list). The index starts from `0` for the first element, `1` for the second, and so on.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     my_list = [10, 20, 30]\n",
    "     print(my_list[0])  # Output: 10\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Heterogeneous**  \n",
    "   - Lists can store elements of different data types (integers, strings, floats, etc.) within the same list.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     mixed_list = [1, \"hello\", 3.14, True]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Dynamic Size**  \n",
    "   - Lists can grow or shrink in size during program execution. You can append elements to a list or remove them.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     my_list = [1, 2]\n",
    "     my_list.append(3)  # Adds 3 to the end of the list\n",
    "     my_list.remove(2)  # Removes the first occurrence of 2\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Supports Nested Lists**  \n",
    "   - Lists can contain other lists (nested lists), allowing for multi-dimensional or hierarchical data structures.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     nested_list = [1, [2, 3], [4, 5]]\n",
    "     print(nested_list[1])  # Output: [2, 3]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Supports Slicing**  \n",
    "   - Lists support **slicing**, which allows you to create a sublist by specifying a range of indices.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n",
    "     sublist = my_list[1:4]  # Output: [20, 30, 40]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Built-in Methods**  \n",
    "   - Python lists come with a variety of useful built-in methods for operations such as adding, removing, searching, and modifying elements:\n",
    "     - `append()` – Add an item to the end of the list.\n",
    "     - `insert()` – Insert an item at a specific index.\n",
    "     - `remove()` – Remove the first occurrence of a value.\n",
    "     - `pop()` – Remove and return an item at a given index (default is the last item).\n",
    "     - `extend()` – Add multiple elements to the end of the list.\n",
    "     - `sort()` – Sort the list in ascending order (can be reversed with `reverse()`).\n",
    "     - `reverse()` – Reverse the order of elements in the list.\n",
    "     - `len()` – Return the number of elements in the list.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     my_list = [3, 1, 2]\n",
    "     my_list.sort()  # Sorts the list in-place\n",
    "     print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Can Contain Duplicate Elements**  \n",
    "   - Lists can contain duplicate elements. This is in contrast to other data structures like sets, which do not allow duplicates.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Supports Iteration**  \n",
    "   - Lists can be iterated over using loops (like `for` loops) or comprehensions, making them very flexible for processing data.\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "     for item in my_list:\n",
    "         print(item)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of a List:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple\n",
    "fruits.append(\"orange\")  # Adds \"orange\" to the end of the list\n",
    "fruits[1] = \"blueberry\"  # Modifies the second item\n",
    "print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry', 'orange']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, lists are versatile, ordered, and mutable collections in Python that support a wide range of operations for adding, removing, and modifying elements, as well as iteration and slicing."

    "In Python, lists are mutable, meaning you can access, modify, and delete elements from them. Here's how you can perform these operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Accessing Elements in a List**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access elements in a list using their **index**. Indexing starts from `0`, and you can also use negative indices to access elements from the end of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing elements by index\n",
    "print(my_list[0])  # Output: 'apple'  (first element)\n",
    "print(my_list[2])  # Output: 'cherry' (third element)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Negative indexing (from the end of the list)\n",
    "print(my_list[-1])  # Output: 'date' (last element)\n",
    "print(my_list[-2])  # Output: 'cherry' (second-to-last element)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Modifying Elements in a List**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since lists are mutable, you can change the value of an element by accessing it via its index and assigning a new value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modify an element by index\n",
    "my_list[1] = 'blueberry'  # Changing 'banana' to 'blueberry'\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modify an element using negative indexing\n",
    "my_list[-1] = 'elderberry'  # Changing 'date' to 'elderberry'\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry', 'elderberry']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Deleting Elements from a List**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to delete elements from a list, including using `del`, `remove()`, and `pop()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.1 **Using `del`** (Deletes an element by index or slices the list)\n",
    "The `del` statement can be used to delete an element at a specific index or to delete a slice of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example (Deleting by index):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Deleting an element by index\n",
    "del my_list[1]  # Removes 'banana' (index 1)\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: ['apple', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example (Deleting a slice):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Deleting a slice (removing 'banana' and 'cherry')\n",
    "del my_list[1:3]  \n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: ['apple', 'date']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 **Using `remove()`** (Removes an element by value)\n",
    "The `remove()` method removes the **first occurrence** of the specified value from the list. If the value doesn't exist, it raises a `ValueError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'banana']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Removing an element by value\n",
    "my_list.remove('banana')  # Removes the first 'banana'\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: ['apple', 'cherry', 'banana']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Trying to remove a value that doesn't exist will raise an error\n",
    "# my_list.remove('orange')  # Uncommenting this line would raise a ValueError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3 **Using `pop()`** (Removes an element by index and returns it)\n",
    "The `pop()` method removes the element at the given index and returns that element. If no index is provided, it removes and returns the last element by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Popping an element by index\n",
    "popped_item = my_list.pop(2)  # Removes and returns the element at index 2 ('cherry')\n",
    "print(popped_item)  # Output: 'cherry'\n",
    "print(my_list)      # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'date']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Popping the last element (if no index is provided)\n",
    "last_item = my_list.pop()\n",
    "print(last_item)    # Output: 'date'\n",
    "print(my_list)      # Output: ['apple', 'banana']\n",
    "```\n",

    "In Python, **tuples** and **lists** are both used to store ordered collections of items, but they have several key differences. Below is a detailed comparison between the two, along with examples for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Mutability**\n",
    "   - **Lists** are **mutable**, meaning their elements can be modified after the list is created (i.e., you can add, remove, or change items).\n",
    "   - **Tuples** are **immutable**, meaning once they are created, their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # List (mutable)\n",
    "   my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "   my_list[1] = 5  # Modify an element\n",
    "   my_list.append(4)  # Add an element\n",
    "   print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 5, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Tuple (immutable)\n",
    "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "   # my_tuple[1] = 5  # This will raise a TypeError because tuples are immutable\n",
    "   # my_tuple.append(4)  # This will raise an AttributeError because tuples don't have append() method\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Syntax**\n",
    "   - **Lists** are defined using square brackets (`[]`).\n",
    "   - **Tuples** are defined using parentheses (`()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list = [1, 2, 3]  # List\n",
    "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)  # Tuple\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Performance**\n",
    "   - **Tuples** are generally faster than **lists** when it comes to iteration and accessing elements because of their immutability.\n",
    "   - **Lists** are more flexible but come with a slight performance overhead due to their mutability.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import time\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Creating a list and tuple with the same elements\n",
    "   list_example = [1] * 1000000\n",
    "   tuple_example = (1,) * 1000000\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Timing list access\n",
    "   start_time = time.time()\n",
    "   _ = list_example[500000]\n",
    "   print(\"List access time:\", time.time() - start_time)\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Timing tuple access\n",
    "   start_time = time.time()\n",
    "   _ = tuple_example[500000]\n",
    "   print(\"Tuple access time:\", time.time() - start_time)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, the tuple will typically have a slightly faster access time compared to the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Use Cases**\n",
    "   - **Lists** are used when you need a collection of items that may change over time (e.g., dynamically modifying data).\n",
    "   - **Tuples** are used when you need an immutable collection of items (e.g., fixed data, or as dictionary keys).\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   - **List use case**: Storing a list of shopping items that may change as you add/remove items.\n",
    "   - **Tuple use case**: Representing coordinates in a 2D or 3D space, which shouldn't change once set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Methods Available**\n",
    "   - **Lists** have a variety of built-in methods to manipulate the list (e.g., `append()`, `remove()`, `extend()`, `pop()`, `insert()`, etc.).\n",
    "   - **Tuples** have fewer methods since they are immutable. The available methods are mainly `count()` and `index()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # List methods\n",
    "   my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "   my_list.append(4)  # Adds 4 to the end of the list\n",
    "   my_list.remove(2)  # Removes the first occurrence of 2\n",
    "   print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Tuple methods\n",
    "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 2)\n",
    "   print(my_tuple.count(2))  # Output: 2 (counts occurrences of 2)\n",
    "   print(my_tuple.index(3))  # Output: 2 (finds the index of the first occurrence of 3)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Memory Usage**\n",
    "   - **Tuples** generally consume less memory than **lists**. This is because tuples are immutable, so Python can optimize them internally.\n",
    "   - **Lists** consume more memory as they are dynamic and support more methods to manipulate the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(sys.getsizeof(my_list))  # Size of list in bytes\n",
    "   print(sys.getsizeof(my_tuple))  # Size of tuple in bytes\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Immutability and Hashability**\n",
    "   - **Tuples** are **hashable** if all their elements are hashable. This means they can be used as keys in dictionaries or stored in sets.\n",
    "   - **Lists** are **not hashable** because they are mutable. You cannot use a list as a dictionary key or store it in a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "   my_dict = {my_tuple: \"value\"}  # Tuples can be used as keys\n",
    "\n",
    "   my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "   # my_dict = {my_list: \"value\"}  # This will raise a TypeError because lists are not hashable\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Nested Structures**\n",
    "   - Both **lists** and **tuples** can contain other lists or tuples (i.e., they can be nested).\n",
    "   - While you can modify the elements of a list inside a nested list, the outer tuple (if it's immutable) cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Nested list\n",
    "   nested_list = [1, [2, 3], 4]\n",
    "   nested_list[1][0] = 5  # Modify an element inside the nested list\n",
    "   print(nested_list)  # Output: [1, [5, 3], 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Nested tuple\n",
    "   nested_tuple = (1, (2, 3), 4)\n",
    "   # nested_tuple[1][0] = 5  # This will raise an error since tuples are immutable\n",
    "   print(nested_tuple)  # Output: (1, (2, 3), 4)\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "In Python, a **set** is an unordered collection of **unique** elements. Sets are highly efficient for membership testing, removing duplicates, and performing mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference. Below are the key features of sets, along with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Unordered Collection**\n",
    "   - Sets do not maintain any particular order for the elements. The order of elements in a set is not guaranteed, and it may change each time you access or print the set.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_set = {3, 1, 2}\n",
    "   print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3} (order may vary)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Unique Elements**\n",
    "   - Sets automatically eliminate **duplicate values**. If you try to add a duplicate element, it will not be added.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5}\n",
    "   print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (duplicates removed)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Mutable**\n",
    "   - Sets are **mutable**, meaning you can add and remove elements after the set is created. However, the elements themselves must be **immutable** (e.g., numbers, strings, or tuples).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_set = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "   my_set.add(4)  # Adds 4 to the set\n",
    "   print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
    "   \n",
    "   my_set.remove(2)  # Removes the element 2\n",
    "   print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 3, 4}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **No Indexing or Slicing**\n",
    "   - Sets do not support indexing, slicing, or other sequence-like behavior (such as accessing elements by position).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_set = {10, 20, 30}\n",
    "   # my_set[1]  # This will raise a TypeError because sets do not support indexing\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Supports Set Operations**\n",
    "   - Sets support **mathematical set operations** like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference, which are useful for comparing sets.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Common set operations:**\n",
    "   - **Union**: Combine elements from two sets (`|` operator or `union()` method).\n",
    "   - **Intersection**: Get common elements from two sets (`&` operator or `intersection()` method).\n",
    "   - **Difference**: Get elements present in the first set but not in the second (`-` operator or `difference()` method).\n",
    "   - **Symmetric Difference**: Get elements that are in either of the sets but not in both (`^` operator or `symmetric_difference()` method).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Examples:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
    "   set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Union (all elements from both sets)\n",
    "   print(set1 | set2)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n",
    "   print(set1.union(set2))  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Intersection (common elements)\n",
    "   print(set1 & set2)  # Output: {3, 4}\n",
    "   print(set1.intersection(set2))  # Output: {3, 4}\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Difference (elements in set1 but not in set2)\n",
    "   print(set1 - set2)  # Output: {1, 2}\n",
    "   print(set1.difference(set2))  # Output: {1, 2}\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Symmetric Difference (elements in either set but not both)\n",
    "   print(set1 ^ set2)  # Output: {1, 2, 5, 6}\n",
    "   print(set1.symmetric_difference(set2))  # Output: {1, 2, 5, 6}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **No Duplicate Elements**\n",
    "   - Sets automatically remove duplicates, making them useful for filtering out repeated items from a collection.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]\n",
    "   unique_set = set(my_list)  # Converts list to a set, removing duplicates\n",
    "   print(unique_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Supports Membership Testing**\n",
    "   - Sets provide very fast membership testing (i.e., checking whether an item exists in the set). This is more efficient than checking for membership in a list, especially with large data sets.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(3 in my_set)  # Output: True\n",
    "   print(6 in my_set)  # Output: False\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Set Comprehension**\n",
    "   - Like lists and dictionaries, sets also support **set comprehension**. This allows you to create sets in a concise and readable manner.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   squares = {x ** 2 for x in range(5)}\n",
    "   print(squares)  # Output: {0, 1, 4, 9, 16}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Set of Frozen Sets**\n",
    "   - **Frozen sets** are immutable sets. Unlike regular sets, you cannot add or remove elements from a frozen set. Frozen sets can be used as dictionary keys because they are hashable.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Frozen set\n",
    "   frozen_set = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    "   print(frozen_set)  # Output: frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4})\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Frozen sets are immutable (no add/remove operations)\n",
    "   # frozen_set.add(5)  # This will raise an AttributeError\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Set as Dictionary Keys**\n",
    "   - **Frozen sets** can be used as keys in dictionaries, but regular sets cannot because they are mutable and not hashable.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   frozen_set = frozenset([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "   my_dict = {frozen_set: \"value\"}  # Frozen sets can be used as dictionary keys\n",
    "   print(my_dict)  # Output: {frozenset({1, 2, 3}): 'value'}\n",
    "\n",
    "   # regular set can't be used as a dictionary key\n",
    "   # my_dict = {set([1, 2, 3]): \"value\"}  # This will raise a TypeError\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "### **Use Cases for Sets**\n",
    "1. **Removing duplicates from a collection**:\n",
    "   - Use sets to remove duplicate values from a list or other iterable.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]\n",
    "   unique_values = set(my_list)\n",

    "   print(set_a | set_b)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4} (Union)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Creating a set of immutable elements**:\n",
    "   - Use `frozenset` for immutable sets that can be used as dictionary keys or stored in other sets.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   frozen_set = frozenset([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",

    "In Python programming, both **tuples** and **sets** are essential data structures, each with unique features that make them well-suited to particular use cases. Here's a breakdown of common **use cases** for tuples and sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Use Cases of Tuples**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are **immutable** ordered collections, which makes them ideal for situations where data should remain constant. Here are some common use cases for tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Storing Fixed Data**\n",
    "   Tuples are often used when you need to store data that should not be modified, such as configuration settings, RGB values, coordinates, or date/time values.\n",
    "   - Example: Storing coordinates (x, y, z) for 3D graphics or location tracking.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   coordinates = (37.7749, -122.4194)  # Latitude and longitude of San Francisco\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Returning Multiple Values from a Function**\n",
    "   A tuple is a great choice when you want to return multiple values from a function. Since tuples are ordered and immutable, they preserve the integrity of the returned data.\n",
    "   - Example: Returning multiple values like a quotient and remainder from a division.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def divide(a, b):\n",
    "       return (a // b, a % b)\n",
    "\n",
    "   result = divide(10, 3)\n",
    "   print(result)  # Output: (3, 1) (quotient, remainder)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Using Tuples as Dictionary Keys**\n",
    "   Tuples, being immutable, can be used as keys in dictionaries, whereas lists cannot because they are mutable. This is useful when you need a composite key (e.g., a combination of multiple elements).\n",
    "   - Example: Using a tuple as a key in a dictionary for storing values based on multiple conditions.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   point = (1, 2)\n",
    "   locations = {(1, 2): \"Point A\", (3, 4): \"Point B\"}\n",
    "   print(locations[point])  # Output: Point A\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Data Integrity and Safety**\n",
    "   Tuples guarantee that their data won't be modified accidentally, making them useful for applications where data integrity is critical. For example, if you are passing data between functions and want to ensure the data cannot be altered, a tuple is a good choice.\n",
    "   - Example: Passing function arguments that should remain constant.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def process_data(data):\n",
    "       # Data should not be modified\n",
    "       print(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "   data = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "   process_data(data)  # Data is protected from accidental modification\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Storing Heterogeneous Data**\n",
    "   Tuples are suitable for storing a fixed collection of heterogeneous (mixed-type) data, such as combinations of different types that logically belong together. Unlike lists, tuples are used to represent collections where the data is not meant to change.\n",
    "   - Example: Storing a person's name, age, and gender together as a tuple.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   person = (\"John\", 30, \"Male\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Optimizing Performance**\n",
    "   Since tuples are immutable, they are generally faster and require less memory than lists. Tuples are often used when performance is critical, especially in scenarios where large amounts of data are involved and the data does not need to be modified.\n",
    "   - Example: Storing a large sequence of constant data that will be iterated over frequently.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   immutable_data = tuple(range(1000000))  # Faster than using a list in some cases\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Use Cases of Sets**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are **unordered collections** that store **unique** elements, making them ideal for scenarios where you need fast membership testing, elimination of duplicates, and set operations. Below are some common use cases for sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Eliminating Duplicates from a Collection**\n",
    "   One of the most common use cases for sets is to remove duplicates from a collection of items, as sets automatically enforce uniqueness.\n",
    "   - Example: Removing duplicates from a list of items.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]\n",
    "   unique_elements = set(my_list)\n",
    "   print(unique_elements)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Efficient Membership Testing**\n",
    "   Sets provide very fast membership testing (i.e., checking if an element exists in a set). This is much faster than doing the same operation on a list, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "   - Example: Checking if an element is in a collection.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   valid_ids = {101, 102, 103, 104}\n",
    "   if 103 in valid_ids:\n",
    "       print(\"ID is valid\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Set Operations (Union, Intersection, Difference, Symmetric Difference)**\n",
    "   Sets are specifically designed to support mathematical set operations, making them ideal for scenarios where you need to compare or combine sets of data. Operations like union, intersection, and difference are optimized for performance.\n",
    "   - Example: Finding common elements (intersection) between two sets.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   set_a = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "   set_b = {3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Intersection\n",
    "   common_elements = set_a & set_b\n",
    "   print(common_elements)  # Output: {3}\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Union\n",
    "   all_elements = set_a | set_b\n",
    "   print(all_elements)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Difference\n",
    "   unique_to_set_a = set_a - set_b\n",
    "   print(unique_to_set_a)  # Output: {1, 2}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Storing Unique Data**\n",
    "   When you need a collection of items but want to ensure that every element is unique (e.g., a set of tags, unique IDs, or user input), sets are the ideal choice.\n",
    "   - Example: Storing unique tags in a tagging system.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   tags = {\"python\", \"data\", \"programming\", \"python\"}\n",
    "   print(tags)  # Output: {'python', 'data', 'programming'} (duplicate 'python' removed)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Set-based Algorithms (e.g., Finding Unique Items)**\n",
    "   Sets are used in algorithms that require checking for unique items, such as when analyzing data for redundancy or determining which items appear only once in a collection.\n",
    "   - Example: Finding unique items from multiple lists.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "   list2 = [3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Finding unique elements across both lists\n",
    "   unique_items = set(list1) ^ set(list2)  # Symmetric difference\n",
    "   print(unique_items)  # Output: {1, 2, 5, 6}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Tracking Elements that Have Been Seen**\n",
    "   Sets are often used for tracking elements that have been encountered in situations like processing large data streams or handling unique events in a simulation.\n",
    "   - Example: Tracking unique users who have logged into a system.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   logged_in_users = set()\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Add user IDs to the set when they log in\n",
    "   logged_in_users.add(101)\n",
    "   logged_in_users.add(102)\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Check if a user is logged in\n",
    "   print(101 in logged_in_users)  # Output: True\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Frozenset as Dictionary Keys**\n",
    "   A **frozenset** is an immutable version of a set, and it can be used as a key in dictionaries, unlike regular sets. Frozensets are useful when you need a hashable version of a set.\n",
    "   - Example: Storing a frozenset as a dictionary key.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   frozenset_key = frozenset([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "   my_dict = {frozenset_key: \"frozen data\"}\n",
    "   print(my_dict)  # Output: {frozenset({1, 2, 3}): 'frozen data'}\n",

    "In Python, a **dictionary** is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key must be unique. You can perform several operations on dictionaries, such as adding, modifying, and deleting items. Below, I'll explain how to perform each of these operations, with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Adding Items to a Dictionary**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add new key-value pairs to a dictionary using either assignment or the `update()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using Assignment**\n",
    "You can directly assign a value to a new key. If the key doesn't exist in the dictionary, it will be created, and the value will be added.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create an initial dictionary\n",
    "my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add a new key-value pair\n",
    "my_dict['c'] = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_dict)\n",
    "# Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using the `update()` Method**\n",
    "The `update()` method can be used to add multiple key-value pairs to the dictionary. If the key already exists, it updates its value. If the key doesn't exist, it adds a new key-value pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create an initial dictionary\n",
    "my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add multiple key-value pairs using update()\n",
    "my_dict.update({'c': 3, 'd': 4})\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_dict)\n",
    "# Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Modifying Items in a Dictionary**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can modify the value associated with a specific key by simply assigning a new value to that key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create an initial dictionary\n",
    "my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modify the value of an existing key\n",
    "my_dict['b'] = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_dict)\n",
    "# Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 5, 'c': 3}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using the `update()` Method to Modify**\n",
    "You can also use the `update()` method to modify the value of one or more keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create an initial dictionary\n",
    "my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modify multiple key-value pairs using update()\n",
    "my_dict.update({'b': 10, 'c': 20})\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_dict)\n",
    "# Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 10, 'c': 20}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Deleting Items from a Dictionary**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can remove items from a dictionary using several methods: `del`, `pop()`, and `popitem()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using `del` Statement**\n",
    "The `del` statement can be used to remove a specific key-value pair by specifying the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create an initial dictionary\n",
    "my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Delete a specific key-value pair\n",
    "del my_dict['b']\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_dict)\n",
    "# Output: {'a': 1, 'c': 3}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the key doesn't exist, a `KeyError` will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using `pop()` Method**\n",
    "The `pop()` method removes and returns the value associated with the specified key. If the key doesn't exist, it raises a `KeyError`, but you can provide a default value to return instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create an initial dictionary\n",
    "my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Remove and return the value associated with key 'b'\n",
    "removed_value = my_dict.pop('b')\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_dict)\n",
    "# Output: {'a': 1, 'c': 3}\n",
    "\n",
    "print(removed_value)\n",
    "# Output: 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can also provide a default value to avoid raising an error if the key doesn't exist:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "removed_value = my_dict.pop('d', 'Key not found')\n",
    "print(removed_value)  # Output: Key not found\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using `popitem()` Method**\n",
    "The `popitem()` method removes and returns the last key-value pair inserted into the dictionary (in Python 3.7 and later, dictionaries maintain insertion order). It raises a `KeyError` if the dictionary is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create an initial dictionary\n",
    "my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Remove and return the last key-value pair\n",
    "removed_item = my_dict.popitem()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(my_dict)\n",
    "# Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n",
    "\n",
    "print(removed_item)\n",
    "# Output: ('c', 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Clearing All Items in a Dictionary**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to remove all items from a dictionary but keep the dictionary itself, you can use the `clear()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create an initial dictionary\n",
    "my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Remove all items from the dictionary\n",

    "In Python, **dictionary keys** must be **immutable**. This is a fundamental requirement for dictionary functionality, as the keys are used to uniquely identify and access the corresponding values in the dictionary. The immutability of keys ensures that the dictionary's internal structure remains consistent and allows for efficient lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Must Dictionary Keys Be Immutable?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hashing Requirement**\n",
    "   - Python dictionaries use a **hash table** for efficient lookup. A hash table stores key-value pairs, and the key is used to compute a **hash value**. This hash value determines the position of the key-value pair in memory, enabling fast access to values by key.\n",
    "   - For an object to be used as a dictionary key, it must have a **hash value** that does not change over time. If a dictionary key were mutable (e.g., a list or a set), its hash value could change after it is inserted into the dictionary. This would break the internal structure of the dictionary, making it impossible to reliably retrieve the value associated with that key.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Consistency and Integrity**\n",
    "   - If the key is mutable, modifying the key (for example, changing a list's elements or a set's items) could cause the dictionary to lose track of the key-value pair. This would lead to unexpected behavior, such as losing access to data or incorrectly associating keys with values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Efficiency of Lookup**\n",
    "   - Immutable objects like integers, strings, and tuples have a consistent and fixed hash value. This allows for efficient lookups, as the hash value remains the same across operations. Mutable objects would introduce additional complexity and inefficiencies in managing hash values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Which Types of Objects Are Immutable?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, **immutable objects** include:\n",
    "- **Numbers** (integers, floats, complex numbers)\n",
    "- **Strings**\n",
    "- **Tuples** (as long as they don't contain mutable elements)\n",
    "- **frozensets** (immutable sets)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, **mutable objects** like **lists**, **sets**, and **dictionaries** cannot be used as dictionary keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: Immutable vs. Mutable Keys**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Valid Dictionary Keys (Immutable)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Valid dictionary keys: integers, strings, tuples, and frozensets\n",
    "\n",
    "# Integer as a key\n",
    "my_dict = {42: \"Answer\"}\n",
    "print(my_dict)  # Output: {42: 'Answer'}\n",
    "\n",
    "# String as a key\n",
    "my_dict = {\"name\": \"Alice\"}\n",
    "print(my_dict)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice'}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tuple as a key\n",
    "my_dict = {(\"x\", \"y\"): \"Coordinates\"}\n",
    "print(my_dict)  # Output: {('x', 'y'): 'Coordinates'}\n",
    "\n",
    "# frozenset as a key\n",
    "my_dict = {frozenset([1, 2, 3]): \"Immutable set\"}\n",
    "print(my_dict)  # Output: {frozenset({1, 2, 3}): 'Immutable set'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Invalid Dictionary Keys (Mutable)**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to use a mutable object like a **list** or **set** as a dictionary key, Python will raise a `TypeError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# List as a dictionary key (Invalid)\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    my_dict = {[1, 2, 3]: \"List key\"}\n",
    "except TypeError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)  # Output: unhashable type: 'list'\n",
    "\n",

    "except TypeError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)  # Output: unhashable type: 'set'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Using a Mutable Key in a Dictionary and Modifying It**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore what happens when you try to use a mutable object (e.g., a list) as a key. Python will allow you to add a list as a key, but if you modify the list after insertion, you can run into issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Try using a list as a dictionary key\n",
    "my_dict = {}\n",
    "key = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add the list as a key (initially works)\n",
    "my_dict[key] = \"Initial value\"\n",
    "print(my_dict)  # Output: {[1, 2, 3]: 'Initial value'}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modify the list (which is mutable)\n",
    "key.append(4)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now the dictionary may not behave correctly because the key's hash value has changed\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    print(my_dict[key])  # This could raise an error or give unexpected results\n",
    "except KeyError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)  # This will raise a KeyError\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code highlights why mutable objects like lists are **not suitable** for dictionary keys: after modifying the list, the hash value changes, and it may no longer correspond to the original position in the dictionary, causing retrieval problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Correct Way to Use Immutable Objects**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to use a combination of values as a key (e.g., coordinate points or database rows), you can use **tuples** or **frozensets**, which are immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using a tuple as a dictionary key (valid)\n",
    "my_dict = {}\n",
    "coordinates = (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "my_dict[coordinates] = \"Point A\"\n",
    "print(my_dict)  # Output: {(1, 2, 3): 'Point A'}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using frozenset as a dictionary key (valid)\n",
    "my_dict = {}\n",
    "immutable_set = frozenset([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "my_dict[immutable_set] = \"Unique set\"\n",
    "print(my_dict)  # Output: {frozenset({1, 2, 3}): 'Unique set'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In these examples, the tuple and frozenset are immutable, so the dictionary can use them as keys without issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary: Importance of Immutable Keys**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Consistency**: Immutability ensures that the hash value of the key remains constant, which is critical for efficient and accurate dictionary lookups.\n",
    "2. **Efficiency**: Immutable objects allow the dictionary to quickly access and update values because their hash values don’t change.\n",
    "3. **Data Integrity**: Immutable keys prevent accidental modification, preserving the integrity of the dictionary structure.\n",
    "4. **Reliability**: If you use mutable objects as keys, their internal data can change, which would corrupt the dictionary and make the hash value unreliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, **immutable keys** are essential for ensuring that dictionaries remain efficient, consistent, and reliable."
