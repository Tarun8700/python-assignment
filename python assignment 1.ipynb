    "\n",
    "### 5. **Interpreted Language**\n",
    "   - Python is an interpreted language, meaning the code is executed line-by-line, making debugging easier and faster. Unlike compiled languages, there is no need to compile the code before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Dynamically Typed**\n",
    "   - In Python, you don't need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly. The type is inferred at runtime. This allows for faster development and reduces boilerplate code, but it also means there can be runtime errors if types are mismatched.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Extensive Community Support**\n",
    "   - Python has a large and active community of developers. This means a wealth of tutorials, forums, open-source code, and other resources are available. When facing a problem, there's a high chance that someone has already solved it and shared the solution online.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Object-Oriented and Functional Programming Support**\n",
    "   - Python supports both **object-oriented** programming (OOP) and **functional programming** paradigms, giving developers flexibility in how they structure their programs. Python's object-oriented features, such as inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, are easy to use.\n",
    "   - Python also includes many functional programming features, like lambda functions, map, filter, and higher-order functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Integration Capabilities**\n",
    "   - Python easily integrates with other languages and technologies. It can call C/C++ code, and C/C++ code can also call Python. Python can also be embedded in applications written in other languages, making it a good choice for scripting within larger systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Open Source**\n",
    "   - Python is free to use, distribute, and modify, which makes it an attractive option for both individual developers and businesses. The open-source nature of Python also ensures continuous improvement and contribution from developers worldwide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. **Dynamic Memory Management**\n",
    "   - Python's memory management system is automatic, and it includes features like **garbage collection** to manage memory efficiently. This reduces the burden on developers when managing memory manually, as is necessary in languages like C.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. **Strong Support for Automation and Scripting**\n",
    "   - Python excels in writing automation scripts. Whether you're automating simple tasks like file renaming or building complex systems like web scrapers or system monitoring tools, Python's simplicity and flexibility make it a great choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. **High-Level Language**\n",
    "   - Python abstracts away low-level details like memory management, which allows developers to focus on solving the problem rather than worrying about technicalities such as memory allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. **Concurrency and Parallelism**\n",
    "   - Python supports **multithreading** and **multiprocessing**, enabling the development of efficient, parallel applications. Libraries like `asyncio` also enable writing asynchronous code for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15. **Robust Testing and Debugging Support**\n",
    "   - Python has excellent support for testing with frameworks like **unittest**, **pytest**, and **nose**, making it easier to write reliable and maintainable code. Additionally, tools like **pdb** (Python debugger) allow for efficient code debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Python's key features, such as its simple syntax, versatility, large standard library, extensive community support, and strong integration capabilities, make it a favorite among developers. These features, combined with the ability to work in a variety of domains from web development to data science, ensure Python remains one of the most widely-used programming languages.

    "\n",
    "2.Describe the role of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a\n",
    "  program.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In Python, predefined keywords (often called **reserved words**) are special words that have a defined meaning within the language's syntax. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names, etc.) because they are reserved for specific functionality within the language. They are essential for defining the structure and behavior of Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role of Predefined Keywords\n",
    "1. **Syntax Control**: Keywords define the syntax and structure of Python programs, such as how control flow (if, else, while, for), function definitions (def), and exception handling (try, except) are written.\n",
    "2. **Language Features**: They control the behavior of the interpreter, allowing for concepts like looping, conditionals, and exception handling.\n",
    "3. **Reserved for Future Use**: Some keywords might be reserved for future versions of Python, even if they don't yet have a specific function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Python Keywords and How They Are Used\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common Python keywords and how they are used in programs:\n",

    "   These keywords are used for looping over iterable objects.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for i in range(5):\n",
    "       print(i)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **`while`**\n",
    "   The `while` keyword is used to create a loop that continues as long as a condition is true.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   count = 0\n",
    "   while count < 3:\n",
    "       print(\"Counting:\", count)\n",
    "       count += 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **`try`, `except`**\n",
    "   These keywords are used for handling exceptions (errors).\n",

    "       def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "           self.name = name\n",
    "       \n",
    "       def bark(self):\n",
    "           print(f\"{self.name} says woof!\")\n",
    "   \n",
    "   dog1 = Dog(\"Buddy\")\n",
    "   dog1.bark()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. **`import`**\n",
    "   The `import` keyword is used to bring in external modules or libraries.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import math\n",
    "   print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. **`None`**\n",
    "   `None` is a special keyword used to represent the absence of a value or a null value.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   result = None\n",
    "   if result is None:\n",
    "       print(\"No result yet\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10. **`and`, `or`, `not`**\n",
    "   These are logical operators used to combine conditional statements.\n",
    "   ```python\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Predefined keywords in Python are integral to the language's syntax and functionality. They help define the structure of programs, control flow, function definitions, error handling, and more. Since these keywords are reserved, they cannot be used as variable or function names, ensuring that the Python interpreter can always recognize their intended meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Compare and contrast mutable and immutable objects in Python with examples\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, objects can be classified as either **mutable** or **immutable** based on whether their state (or value) can be changed after they are created. Understanding the difference between these two types of objects is fundamental when working with variables, data structures, and memory management in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Mutable Objects**\n",
    "A **mutable** object is one whose value or state can be modified after it is created. In other words, mutable objects can be changed in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Mutable Objects:\n",
    "- Lists\n",
    "- Dictionaries\n",
    "- Sets\n",
    "- User-defined classes (objects of class instances)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characteristics of Mutable Objects:\n",
    "- **Can be changed after creation**: You can modify, add, or delete elements in mutable objects.\n",
    "- **Memory Efficiency**: Since the object is modified in place, it typically doesn't require creating a new object in memory.\n",
    "- **Implications for Functions**: If a mutable object is passed to a function, changes made to the object within the function will affect the original object outside the function (pass-by-reference behavior).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Mutable Object (List):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Mutable Object: List\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "print(\"Original list:\", numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modify the list\n",
    "numbers.append(4)\n",
    "numbers[0] = 10\n",
    "print(\"Modified list:\", numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Original list: [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "Modified list: [10, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the list `numbers` is mutable. We can add new elements to it (`append(4)`) and change the value of existing elements (`numbers[0] = 10`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Mutable Object in Functions:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def modify_list(lst):\n",
    "    lst.append(100)  # Modify the list in place\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "modify_list(my_list)\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 100]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the original list `my_list` is modified directly inside the function, showing the behavior of mutable objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Immutable Objects**\n",
    "An **immutable** object is one whose value or state cannot be changed after it is created. If any operation tries to modify the object, a new object is created instead of modifying the existing one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Immutable Objects:\n",
    "- Integers\n",
    "- Floats\n",
    "- Strings\n",
    "- Tuples\n",
    "- Frozensets\n",
    "- Namedtuples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characteristics of Immutable Objects:\n",
    "- **Cannot be changed after creation**: Once an immutable object is created, it cannot be altered.\n",
    "- **Memory Efficiency**: Since these objects cannot be modified in place, any modification results in a new object being created.\n",
    "- **Implications for Functions**: If an immutable object is passed to a function, the original object will remain unchanged, as any changes inside the function will result in a new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Immutable Object (String):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Immutable Object: String\n",
    "text = \"Hello\"\n",
    "print(\"Original text:\", text)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Trying to modify the string (creates a new string)\n",
    "text = text.replace(\"H\", \"J\")\n",
    "print(\"Modified text:\", text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Original text: Hello\n",
    "Modified text: Jello\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the string `text` is immutable. The `replace()` method creates a new string with the modified content, leaving the original string unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Immutable Object in Functions:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def modify_string(s):\n",
    "    s = s + \" World\"  # Creates a new string, doesn't modify the original\n",
    "    return s\n",
    "\n",
    "my_str = \"Hello\"\n",
    "new_str = modify_string(my_str)\n",
    "print(my_str)  # Output: Hello\n",
    "print(new_str)  # Output: Hello World\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, even though we modify the string inside the function, the original string `my_str` remains unchanged because strings are immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Key Differences Between Mutable and Immutable Objects**\n",

    "| **Hashability**                | Not hashable (e.g., lists and dictionaries) | Hashable (e.g., tuples and strings)      |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Important Observations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hashing**: Immutable objects like strings and tuples are hashable, meaning they can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets. Mutable objects like lists and dictionaries are not hashable because their state can change, which could alter their hash value.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Performance Considerations**: For large objects, mutability can be more efficient, as you modify the object in place rather than creating new copies. However, immutability often makes code simpler and easier to reason about, especially in concurrent or multi-threaded programming, where shared mutable objects can cause unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Immutability and Safety**: Immutability can prevent bugs related to inadvertent changes to objects. Since immutable objects can't be altered, you don't need to worry about one part of your program modifying an object in a way that other parts depend on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Summary of Mutable vs Immutable Objects**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mutable objects** can be modified after creation and support in-place updates (e.g., lists, dictionaries).\n",
    "- **Immutable objects** cannot be modified after creation, and any modification creates a new object (e.g., strings, tuples, integers).\n",
    "- Mutable objects are more flexible but require careful handling in certain contexts (e.g., functions or multi-threading), while immutable objects offer safety and simplicity at the cost of potential inefficiency when modifications are frequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the difference between mutable and immutable objects helps in writing efficient, bug-free, and predictable Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Discuss the different types of operators in Python and provide examples of how they are used\n",

    "\n",
    "### Type Casting in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type casting** in Python refers to the process of converting one data type to another. Python provides several built-in functions to perform **explicit** (manual) and **implicit** (automatic) type conversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implicit Type Casting (Automatic)**: Python automatically converts one data type to another, usually when it does not result in data loss.\n",
    "- **Explicit Type Casting (Manual)**: You manually convert one data type to another using functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Implicit Type Casting (Automatic)**\n",
    "\n",
    "In **implicit type casting**, Python automatically converts one data type to another when required, usually when there's no risk of losing information or precision. This happens when a smaller or less precise data type is used in an operation that requires a larger or more precise one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10    # Integer\n",
    "y = 5.5   # Float\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python automatically converts the integer to a float during addition\n",
    "result = x + y\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 15.5 (The integer 10 is automatically converted to float)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, Python converts `x` (an integer) to a float because `y` is a float. The result of the addition is a float.\n",

    "2. **Loss of Data**: Converting from a more precise type (like float) to a less precise type (like integer) can result in loss of data (e.g., truncating decimals).\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 3.99\n",
    "   y = int(x)  # The decimal part is lost, so y = 3\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Type Compatibility**: Not all data types can be converted to others. For example, you can't directly convert a string like `\"True\"` to a boolean without first parsing it:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = \"True\"\n",
    "   y = bool(x)  # This gives True because any non-empty string is considered True.\n",

    "6. How do conditional statements work in Python? Illustrate with examples0\n",
    "\n",
    "   ### Conditional Statements in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements in Python are used to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a condition is `True` or `False`. They are fundamental for controlling the flow of execution in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports the following types of conditional statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`if` statement** — Executes a block of code if the condition is `True`.\n",
    "2. **`else` statement** — Executes a block of code if the condition in the `if` statement is `False`.\n",
    "3. **`elif` statement** — Stands for \"else if\" and is used to check multiple conditions. It is optional and follows an `if` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax of Conditional Statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # Block of code executed if condition is True\n",
    "elif another_condition:\n",
    "    # Block of code executed if another_condition is True\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Block of code executed if no previous condition is True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Conditional Statements Work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`if`**: The `if` statement evaluates a condition (an expression that results in `True` or `False`). If the condition is `True`, the indented block of code under `if` is executed.\n",
    "2. **`elif`**: If the condition in the `if` statement is `False`, the program checks the next `elif` condition. This can be used to check multiple conditions.\n",
    "3. **`else`**: If none of the `if` or `elif` conditions are `True`, the block of code under `else` will be executed (if `else` is provided).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Conditional Statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write a simple program that checks whether a number entered by the user is positive, negative, or zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Get input from the user\n",
    "num = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check the condition using if, elif, and else\n",
    "if num > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is positive.\")\n",
    "elif num < 0:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is negative.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is zero.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **`num > 0`**: The program first checks if the number is greater than 0 (i.e., positive). If this condition is true, it prints \"The number is positive.\"\n",
    "2. **`elif num < 0`**: If the first condition is false, the program checks if the number is less than 0 (i.e., negative). If this condition is true, it prints \"The number is negative.\"\n",
    "3. **`else`**: If both previous conditions are false (i.e., the number is neither positive nor negative), the program defaults to the `else` block and prints \"The number is zero.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Runs:\n",

    "   ### Loops in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is met. Python provides two main types of loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`for` loop** – Iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) and executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.\n",
    "2. **`while` loop** – Repeats a block of code as long as a given condition is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discuss each type in detail and provide examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **`for` Loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop in Python is generally used to iterate over a sequence of elements (such as a list, tuple, string, or range). It executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for item in sequence:\n",
    "    # Block of code to be executed for each item\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Use Cases:\n",
    "- Iterating over a collection (like a list, tuple, or dictionary).\n",
    "- Iterating over a range of numbers using the `range()` function.\n",
    "- String manipulation, where each character is processed individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Iterating Over a List\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    print(fruit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "apple\n",
    "banana\n",
    "cherry\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- The `for` loop iterates through each element in the `fruits` list and prints the name of the fruit.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Example 2: Using `range()` to Iterate Over a Sequence of Numbers\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(1, 6):  # Range from 1 to 5\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- The `range(1, 6)` generates numbers from 1 to 5, and the `for` loop iterates over each number, printing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **`while` Loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` loop is used to repeat a block of code as long as a given condition is `True`. This loop is more flexible than the `for` loop because it doesn't require a sequence to iterate over; it simply repeats as long as a condition remains true.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    # Block of code to be executed as long as the condition is True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Use Cases:\n",
    "- Repeating an operation until a specific condition is met (e.g., waiting for user input, checking for errors).\n",
    "- When the number of iterations is not known in advance.\n",
    "- Implementing game loops or certain types of animations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Counting Using a `while` Loop\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "while count <= 5:\n",
    "    print(count)\n",
    "    count += 1  # Increment the counter\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- The `while` loop continues executing as long as `count` is less than or equal to 5. Each time through the loop, `count` is printed and then incremented by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: User Input Validation with `while` Loop\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    user_input = input(\"Enter 'yes' to continue or 'no' to exit: \")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if user_input.lower() == 'yes':\n",
    "        print(\"Continuing...\")\n",
    "        break  # Exit the loop\n",
    "    elif user_input.lower() == 'no':\n",
    "        print(\"Exiting...\")\n",
    "        break  # Exit the loop\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter 'yes' or 'no'.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- This loop will keep asking the user to input either 'yes' or 'no' until they provide a valid response. If the user enters 'yes', it prints \"Continuing...\" and breaks out of the loop. If the user enters 'no', it prints \"Exiting...\" and breaks the loop.\n",
    "- If an invalid input is provided, it prompts the user again, continuing the loop.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Additional Loop Controls**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides the following statements to control loops more precisely:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`break`**: Exits the loop immediately, regardless of the loop's condition.\n",
    "- **`continue`**: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.\n",
    "- **`else`**: Optionally, a block of code can be added after the loop, which will execute when the loop finishes normally (i.e., not interrupted by `break`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Using `break` to Exit a Loop\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(1, 10):\n",
    "    if i == 5:\n",
    "        break  # Exit the loop when i equals 5\n",
    "    print(i)\n",

    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- The loop runs until `i` reaches 5, at which point the `break` statement is executed, and the loop terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Using `continue` to Skip an Iteration\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "    if i == 3:\n",
    "        continue  # Skip printing 3\n",

    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "4\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- When `i` is equal to 3, the `continue` statement skips that iteration, so 3 is not printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Using `else` with a Loop\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Loop completed successfully.\")\n",

    "4\n",
    "5\n",
    "Loop completed successfully.\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- The `else` block executes only if the loop completes normally (i.e., without being interrupted by `break`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`for` loop**: Best for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) or when you know the number of iterations in advance.\n",
    "- **`while` loop**: Best for situations where the number of iterations is not known, and you need to repeat as long as a condition holds true.\n",
    "- Python's loops can be controlled further using `break`, `continue`, and `else` to manage the flow of execution within the loop.\n",

    "2.Describe the role of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a\n",
    "  program.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In Python, predefined keywords (often called **reserved words**) are special words that have a defined meaning within the language's syntax. These keywords cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable names, function names, etc.) because they are reserved for specific functionality within the language. They are essential for defining the structure and behavior of Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role of Predefined Keywords\n",
    "1. **Syntax Control**: Keywords define the syntax and structure of Python programs, such as how control flow (if, else, while, for), function definitions (def), and exception handling (try, except) are written.\n",
    "2. **Language Features**: They control the behavior of the interpreter, allowing for concepts like looping, conditionals, and exception handling.\n",
    "3. **Reserved for Future Use**: Some keywords might be reserved for future versions of Python, even if they don't yet have a specific function.\n",
    "\n",

    "### 1. **Mutable Objects**\n",
    "A **mutable** object is one whose value or state can be modified after it is created. In other words, mutable objects can be changed in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Mutable Objects:\n",
    "- Lists\n",
    "- Dictionaries\n",
    "- Sets\n",
    "- User-defined classes (objects of class instances)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Characteristics of Mutable Objects:\n",
    "- **Can be changed after creation**: You can modify, add, or delete elements in mutable objects.\n",
    "- **Memory Efficiency**: Since the object is modified in place, it typically doesn't require creating a new object in memory.\n",
    "- **Implications for Functions**: If a mutable object is passed to a function, changes made to the object within the function will affect the original object outside the function (pass-by-reference behavior).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Mutable Object (List):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Mutable Object: List\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "print(\"Original list:\", numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Modify the list\n",
    "numbers.append(4)\n",
    "numbers[0] = 10\n",
    "print(\"Modified list:\", numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Original list: [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "Modified list: [10, 2, 3, 4]\n",

    "In this example, the list `numbers` is mutable. We can add new elements to it (`append(4)`) and change the value of existing elements (`numbers[0] = 10`).\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. **Immutable Objects**\n",

    "- **Memory Efficiency**: Since these objects cannot be modified in place, any modification results in a new object being created.\n",
    "- **Implications for Functions**: If an immutable object is passed to a function, the original object will remain unchanged, as any changes inside the function will result in a new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of Immutable Object (String):\n",

    "### 4. **Important Observations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hashing**: Immutable objects like strings and tuples are hashable, meaning they can be used as keys in dictionaries or elements in sets. Mutable objects like lists and dictionaries are not hashable because their state can change, which could alter their hash value.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Performance Considerations**: For large objects, mutability can be more efficient, as you modify the object in place rather than creating new copies. However, immutability often makes code simpler and easier to reason about, especially in concurrent or multi-threaded programming, where shared mutable objects can cause unexpected behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Immutability and Safety**: Immutability can prevent bugs related to inadvertent changes to objects. Since immutable objects can't be altered, you don't need to worry about one part of your program modifying an object in a way that other parts depend on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Summary of Mutable vs Immutable Objects**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mutable objects** can be modified after creation and support in-place updates (e.g., lists, dictionaries).\n",
    "- **Immutable objects** cannot be modified after creation, and any modification creates a new object (e.g., strings, tuples, integers).\n",
    "- Mutable objects are more flexible but require careful handling in certain contexts (e.g., functions or multi-threading), while immutable objects offer safety and simplicity at the cost of potential inefficiency when modifications are frequent.\n",

    "5.Explain the concept of type casting in Python with examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Type Casting in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type casting** in Python refers to the process of converting one data type to another. Python provides several built-in functions to perform **explicit** (manual) and **implicit** (automatic) type conversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implicit Type Casting (Automatic)**: Python automatically converts one data type to another, usually when it does not result in data loss.\n",
    "- **Explicit Type Casting (Manual)**: You manually convert one data type to another using functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Implicit Type Casting (Automatic)**\n",
    "\n",
    "In **implicit type casting**, Python automatically converts one data type to another when required, usually when there's no risk of losing information or precision. This happens when a smaller or less precise data type is used in an operation that requires a larger or more precise one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10    # Integer\n",
    "y = 5.5   # Float\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python automatically converts the integer to a float during addition\n",
    "result = x + y\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 15.5 (The integer 10 is automatically converted to float)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, Python converts `x` (an integer) to a float because `y` is a float. The result of the addition is a float.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. **Explicit Type Casting (Manual)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicit type casting is performed when you need to manually convert a variable from one type to another. You can use built-in Python functions to explicitly convert between types. Some common type conversion functions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `int()` — Converts a value to an integer.\n",
    "- `float()` — Converts a value to a float.\n",
    "- `str()` — Converts a value to a string.\n",
    "- `list()` — Converts an iterable to a list.\n",
    "- `tuple()` — Converts an iterable to a tuple.\n",
    "- `bool()` — Converts a value to a boolean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Converting String to Integer\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = \"10\"  # String\n",
    "print(type(x))  # <class 'str'>\n",

    "y = int(x)\n",
    "print(type(y))  # <class 'int'>\n",
    "print(y)  # Output: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the string `\"10\"` is explicitly converted to the integer `10` using `int()`.\n",

    "### 5. **Limitations of Type Casting**\n",
    "\n",
    "While type casting is useful, there are some limitations and pitfalls to be aware of:\n",
    "1. **Invalid conversions**: If you try to convert a string that doesn't represent a valid number (e.g., `\"abc\"`), Python will raise a `ValueError`.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = \"abc\"\n",
    "   y = int(x)  # This will raise ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Loss of Data**: Converting from a more precise type (like float) to a less precise type (like integer) can result in loss of data (e.g., truncating decimals).\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 3.99\n",
    "   y = int(x)  # The decimal part is lost, so y = 3\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Type Compatibility**: Not all data types can be converted to others. For example, you can't directly convert a string like `\"True\"` to a boolean without first parsing it:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = \"True\"\n",
    "   y = bool(x)  # This gives True because any non-empty string is considered True.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Type casting in Python allows you to convert values between different data types. There are two main ways of performing type casting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Implicit casting**: Python automatically converts types when it's safe to do so (e.g., integer to float).\n",
    "- **Explicit casting**: You manually convert types using functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Python's type system is flexible, you should be mindful of the potential pitfalls like loss of precision or invalid conversions when casting between types.\n",

    "6. How do conditional statements work in Python? Illustrate with examples0\n",
    "\n",
    "   ### Conditional Statements in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements in Python are used to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a condition is `True` or `False`. They are fundamental for controlling the flow of execution in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports the following types of conditional statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`if` statement** — Executes a block of code if the condition is `True`.\n",
    "2. **`else` statement** — Executes a block of code if the condition in the `if` statement is `False`.\n",
    "3. **`elif` statement** — Stands for \"else if\" and is used to check multiple conditions. It is optional and follows an `if` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax of Conditional Statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # Block of code executed if condition is True\n",
    "elif another_condition:\n",
    "    # Block of code executed if another_condition is True\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # Block of code executed if no previous condition is True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Conditional Statements Work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`if`**: The `if` statement evaluates a condition (an expression that results in `True` or `False`). If the condition is `True`, the indented block of code under `if` is executed.\n",
    "2. **`elif`**: If the condition in the `if` statement is `False`, the program checks the next `elif` condition. This can be used to check multiple conditions.\n",
    "3. **`else`**: If none of the `if` or `elif` conditions are `True`, the block of code under `else` will be executed (if `else` is provided).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Conditional Statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write a simple program that checks whether a number entered by the user is positive, negative, or zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Get input from the user\n",
    "num = float(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check the condition using if, elif, and else\n",
    "if num > 0:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is positive.\")\n",
    "elif num < 0:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is negative.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"The number is zero.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "1. **`num > 0`**: The program first checks if the number is greater than 0 (i.e., positive). If this condition is true, it prints \"The number is positive.\"\n",
    "2. **`elif num < 0`**: If the first condition is false, the program checks if the number is less than 0 (i.e., negative). If this condition is true, it prints \"The number is negative.\"\n",
    "3. **`else`**: If both previous conditions are false (i.e., the number is neither positive nor negative), the program defaults to the `else` block and prints \"The number is zero.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Runs:\n",
    "- **Example 1 (Positive Number)**:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Enter a number: 7\n",
    "  The number is positive.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example 2 (Negative Number)**:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Enter a number: -4\n",
    "  The number is negative.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example 3 (Zero)**:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Enter a number: 0\n",
    "  The number is zero.\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- The **`if`** block is executed only if the condition is `True`.\n",
    "- **`elif`** allows you to check additional conditions if the first one fails.\n",
    "- **`else`** is executed if none of the conditions are `True`.\n",
    "- Conditions are evaluated in order: the first condition is checked, and if it's `False`, the program moves to the next `elif` (if provided) or to `else` (if present).\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, conditional statements help control the flow of the program based on various conditions, allowing for more dynamic and responsive behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Describe the different types of loops in Python and their use cases with examples\n",
    "   ### Loops in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is met. Python provides two main types of loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`for` loop** – Iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) and executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.\n",
    "2. **`while` loop** – Repeats a block of code as long as a given condition is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discuss each type in detail and provide examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **`for` Loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop in Python is generally used to iterate over a sequence of elements (such as a list, tuple, string, or range). It executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for item in sequence:\n",
    "    # Block of code to be executed for each item\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Use Cases:\n",
    "- Iterating over a collection (like a list, tuple, or dictionary).\n",
    "- Iterating over a range of numbers using the `range()` function.\n",
    "- String manipulation, where each character is processed individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Iterating Over a List\n",

    "```\n",
    "apple\n",
    "banana\n",
    "cherry\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- The `for` loop iterates through each element in the `fruits` list and prints the name of the fruit.\n",

    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Output**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "3\n",
    "4\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- The `range(1, 6)` generates numbers from 1 to 5, and the `for` loop iterates over each number, printing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **`while` Loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `while` loop is used to repeat a block of code as long as a given condition is `True`. This loop is more flexible than the `for` loop because it doesn't require a sequence to iterate over; it simply repeats as long as a condition remains true.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    # Block of code to be executed as long as the condition is True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Use Cases:\n",
    "- Repeating an operation until a specific condition is met (e.g., waiting for user input, checking for errors).\n",
    "- When the number of iterations is not known in advance.\n",
    "- Implementing game loops or certain types of animations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 1: Counting Using a `while` Loop\n",

    "- The `while` loop continues executing as long as `count` is less than or equal to 5. Each time through the loop, `count` is printed and then incremented by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example 2: User Input Validation with `while` Loop\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while True:\n",

    "    \n",
    "    if user_input.lower() == 'yes':\n",
    "        print(\"Continuing...\")\n",

    "        print(\"Exiting...\")\n",
    "        break  # Exit the loop\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter 'yes' or 'no'.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "- This loop will keep asking the user to input either 'yes' or 'no' until they provide a valid response. If the user enters 'yes', it prints \"Continuing...\" and breaks out of the loop. If the user enters 'no', it prints \"Exiting...\" and breaks the loop.\n",
    "- If an invalid input is provided, it prompts the user again, continuing the loop.\n",
